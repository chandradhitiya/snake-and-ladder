   ```

2. Install the required packages:

## How to Play

### Command-line Interface

1. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python snake_ladder_game.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Enter the number of players (2-4)
   - Enter names for each player
   - Take turns rolling the dice by pressing Enter
   - First player to reach square 100 exactly wins!

### Web Interface

1. Start the Flask web server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

3. From the web interface:
   - Click "Start New Game"
   - Enter the number of players and their names
   - Click "Roll Dice" on each player's turn
   - Watch as players move around the board
   - First to reach square 100 wins!

## Game Rules

1. Players take turns rolling a single die to move their token.
2. To start the game, a player must roll a 6.
3. The tokens move according to the number shown on the die.
4. If a player's token lands on the lower end of a ladder, the token moves up to the ladder's higher end.
5. If a player's token lands on the head of a snake, the token moves down to the tail of the snake.
6. The first player to reach exactly square 100 is the winner.
7. If the die roll would take a player beyond square 100, the player's token doesn't move and the turn passes to the next player.
